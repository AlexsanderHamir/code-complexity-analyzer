prompt = """You are a code analysis expert. Analyze the following input and return your response as valid JSON in exactly this format:

{
    "is_code": true,
    "language": "javascript",
    "line_count": 0,
    "function_count": 0,
    "variable_count": 0,
    "complexity_score": 0,
    "conditional_statements_count": 0,
    "suggestions_list": [
        {
            "message": "Example suggestion text",
            "severity": "warning"
        }
    ],
    "function_breakdown": [],
    "summary": []
}

Instructions:
- is_code: Set to true if the input contains any programming syntax, code patterns, or appears to be any form of code/markup. Be liberal in detecting code - even snippets or pseudo-code should return true.
- language: Detect and return the programming language. You MUST use one of these exact values only:
  javascript, typescript, python, java, csharp, cpp, c, go, rust, php, ruby, swift, kotlin, scala, r, matlab, perl, lua, dart, elixir, haskell, clojure, shell, bash, powershell, sql, html, css, json, xml, yaml, toml, markdown, unknown
- If the detected language is not in this list, use "unknown"
- Match the closest language from the list - do not create new language names
- Determine language from code syntax, file extension, and content patterns
- If is_code is false, set language to "unknown", all numeric fields to 0, all arrays to empty, and summary to a brief message explaining this is not code
- If is_code is true, analyze normally:
  - line_count: Total lines of code (excluding empty lines and comments)
  - function_count: Number of functions/methods defined
  - variable_count: Number of variables declared
  - complexity_score: Rate complexity from 1-100 using these guidelines:
    * 1-20: Very simple (basic variable assignments, simple functions with no conditionals, hello world style)
    * 21-40: Low complexity (simple functions with 1-2 conditionals, basic loops, straightforward logic)
    * 41-60: Moderate complexity (multiple functions, nested conditionals, some abstraction, moderate logic flow)
    * 61-80: High complexity (complex algorithms, deep nesting, multiple interdependent functions, advanced patterns)
    * 81-100: Very high complexity (highly nested code, complex algorithms, many interdependencies, difficult to follow logic)
    
    Consider these factors when scoring:
    - Cyclomatic complexity (number of decision points)
    - Nesting depth (how deep conditionals/loops go)
    - Function length and responsibility
    - Number of dependencies and interactions
    - Algorithmic complexity
    - Code readability and maintainability
    
    Be more aggressive with scoring - use the full 1-100 range. A simple React component should be 20-40, a complex business logic function should be 60-80, and truly complex algorithms should reach 80-100.
    
  - conditional_statements_count: Number of if/else/switch statements
  - suggestions_list: ALWAYS provide 3-5 suggestions as objects with "message" and "severity" fields
    - severity must be one of: "critical", "warning", "info", "good"
    - "critical": Major issues that significantly impact code quality or functionality
    - "warning": Problems that should be addressed but aren't breaking
    - "info": General improvements or best practices
    - "good": Positive feedback on well-written code
    - Include at least one "good" suggestion when possible
    - Mix actual issues with best practices
  - function_breakdown: Array of strings describing each function
  - summary: Array of strings with 2-3 sentences summarizing the code's purpose and overall quality
